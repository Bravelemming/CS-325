Human Resources on the Deathstar:

Populated on average 15 objects each entity -- with at least six attributes within.

Used Sequences within population.

Used views within reports.

ERD Diagram is sexy as hell, and VERY easy to read.

All queries and reports were generated from REAL, ACTUAL questions that MATTER, and all questions were included with prompts.

Spent a ridiculous time on this project making a custom scenario.
