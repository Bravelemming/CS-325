Scenario Name: Human Resources on board the Deathstar
--
The death star (DS-1) is a moon sized deep space battlestation, and Greg is in charge of its Human Resources department!

Greg is responsible for monitoring all employees of four distinct types; officers, hourly workers, free contractors, and salaried employees of varying combat eligibility.  
Greg has also been tasked with tracking meetings, of which any one employee must run as a chairman and all meetings must be held at a physical location within the deathstar.  
Greg is tracking all employees' planet of origin, as well as that planet's political affiliations and leanings.  
Finally, Greg must help support "destruction level events" when the death star fires its main cannons at a real target, which requires unbelievable amounts of paperwork, as an officer must be present to direct it.

Best of all, employees can earn a promotion!  (Except for free contractors.)   
The employee can also become employee of the month and receives a bonus and a convenient parking space in the hangar bay which they can keep as long as they are an active employee.
