	A is exclusively/write locked with T1, so it can both write or read.

problem 2 - 5 b

	T2 can read C only.

problem 2 - 5 c

	T3 will obtain the lock, as nothing is locking D.

problem 2 - 5 d

	T4 will obtain a shared lock on C.

problem 2 - 5 e

	T5 will have to wait, as C is shared locked to T2.
